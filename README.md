**# ImgSecure

**ImgSecure** is an intuitive Java-based Android application that empowers users with the ability to encrypt sensitive data into images and decrypt the data from the images when needed. This application utilizes steganographic principles to ensure that the data remains invisible within the image yet is retrievable through the decryption process.

## Features

- **Data Encryption**: Conceal text data within an image, effectively encrypting the data and maintaining the original appearance of the image.
- **Data Decryption**: Extract and decrypt the text data previously embedded into an image.
- **Ease of Use**: A user-friendly interface designed for simplicity and ease of operation.
- **High Security**: Implements secure encryption methods to safeguard your data within the image.
